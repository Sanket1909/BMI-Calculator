Introduction: Learned from https://codewithchris.com 14 Day Challenge (SwiftUI)

Description: Users can press a button to generate two different cards and compare which the bigger number is. In default, the left hand side of the card is the player and the other side is the CPU. Each round, if the player gets the bigger card, the player's score will add 1 point, and vice versa. By the end of the game, if rounds >= 10 && playScore != cpuScore, it will show one alert window to know who the winner is.
